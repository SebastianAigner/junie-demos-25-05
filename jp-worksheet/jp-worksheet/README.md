## worksheet
there is a file in `input/worksheet.json`. You can ask it to:
- Create a command-line language trainer, showing one sentence, and waiting for the user to enter their result, then revealing the correct sentence
- translate the worksheet into three other languages
- create a Kotlin program that outputs an standalone interactive HTML worksheet based on the input in input.json in that looks modern. You can follow up with things like "allow the user to hover over the text to reveal the real result."
