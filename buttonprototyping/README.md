# button prototyping

you can ask Junie to:
- Change the app to look more like a forest
- Put a counter on the button and increment it every time it is clicked
- (any other UI modifications that seem easy to do)
- implement rising bubbles in the background

when running with Hot Reload enabled, you'll be able to see changes without restarting the app. Make sure you use the latest IDEA and appropriate gutter icon for it.
