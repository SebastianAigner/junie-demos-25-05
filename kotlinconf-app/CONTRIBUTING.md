### Reporting issues

We use GitHub for issue tracking, which is the primary feedback channel for the app. If you have an issue to report, please check [existing issues](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlinconf-app/issues) before opening a new one.

### Submitting changes

The project is designed and primarily developed by JetBrains. This repository serves as an official sample for [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/kotlin-multiplatform/), [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/), and related technologies.

Community contributions are welcome, with the following notes:

* Feel free to open PRs for trivial fixes (typos, small bugs).
* If you're planning to contribute something nontrivial, please open an issue to discuss it first, to make sure we agree with the proposed changes. This greatly increases the chances of getting a significant contribution accepted.
* When making changes, follow the established formatting, conventions, and patterns in the codebase. 
* When introducing UI changes, please include screenshots or screencasts in the PR.
