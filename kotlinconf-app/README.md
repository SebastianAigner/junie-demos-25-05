# KotlinConf app

you can run the app with hot reload enabled, and ask Junie:
- to implement the speaker's screen (it's missing in this version of the app)
- to give the entire app a blue theme
- to make everything more round / more square

if you run it with hot reload enabled, you should be able to see updates even without restarting the app.
(use the appropriate gutter icon in the latest IDEA version)
